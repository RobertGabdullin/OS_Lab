	The avoidance strategy checks if granting a request results in an unsafe state (provides / does not provide resources depending on the state). Compared to a prevention strategy, this method does not take away resources from processes. Moreover, this method does not provide resources for processing only if it definitely leads to a deadlock. In case of Prevention strategy, it prevents the process from starting if it could theoretically lead to a deadlock. 
	However, the avoidance method has some limitations. (The problem of one method in favor of the other). To implement the avoidance method, the operating system must know in advance information about the requested resources of the processes. In addition to this, if the process receives all the resources it needs, it must free it for some time. Otherwise, the method will not work.
	The recovery method allows you to start all processes and provide all the necessary resources. But the operating system must check for a deadlock every time. The main problem with this algorithm is to detect a deadlock and make it within a reasonable time frame.
